# Build script

The `build.sh` script and `Dockerfile` in this directory can be used to build a
tarball of the PODS codebase for deployment to production servers (which don't
have Docker or Composer).

1. Run `./build.sh` to generate the tarball.
2. Copy this tarball to the production server.
3. Unpack it (READ BELOW FIRST!!!)
   1. On the FIRST installation, the whole directory should be unpacked.
   2. On UPDATE releases, unpack everything EXCEPT the `web/sites` directory.
      The `web/sites` directory is necessary for persistence of `settings.php`,
      uploaded files, temporary files generated by Drupal, etc.
